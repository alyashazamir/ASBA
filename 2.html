<td>Pasti Al-Hidayah; a kindergarten located 5 mins driving from my house. It is a really small school but the enviroment is great. The uniform is cute because they have their own custom uniform and also veil. The uniform color is green. It is a really active kindergaten where we would always being called to perform at nearest events; most of the time we sing nasheed songs. Near the kindergarten, there is a stall that sells my fav nasi lemak with ayam kicap. The teachers (mostly ustazah) are great people; always took care of us if our parents come late to pick us up. The syllibus contains many subject that driven to religion such as we learn arabic, how to pray, recite surah, and they also teach us prayer for eating, after eating, and many more. I feel fortunate because I can attend this kindergarten, because later in primary school I realised that not a lot of people learn the basic that I have learnt in this kindergarten. It is a great experience. Overall, I will rate it 10/10 and definitely would rewind it all over again. </td>

<td>I started attending Sekolah Kebangsaan Berapit from year 2006 until 2011.  The school is located near my grandparents house. After my siblings and I come back from school, we would always go to our grandparents house to learn to recite Al-quran from them; when it is Wednesday and Thursday. The school is medium in size. There are 3 class in each grade which are Bestari, Ceria and Dedikasi. From grade 1 to 6, I was always placed in class of Bestari. The teahers are great people. I really love going to school just for the learning. At this time, I realize that kindergaten is important because all the things that I have learned before does have a purpose. In this school,  I still learn arabic, so it gives me a huge advantage. I did achieve the best scored in arabic. It is a great experience. Overall, I will rate it 10/10 and definitely would rewind It all over again. </td>

<td>Sekolah Menengah Agama Sungai Petani is a school with hostel. This school is a little bit far from my home, so my parents decided to put me in the hostel. I did rebel for the first year, but I realize that it is such a childish move, so  I decided to just go with the flow.  I did end up liking the school a lot. It is a small school, but what I love the most is it is located beside a mosque; . Everyday, we are obliged to pray at the mosque. As what I said, the school is small but it gives a lot advantage, because the students are not that many, the teachers attention are only for us. The teachers are great. I met a lot of people that is worth to befriend. It is a great experience. Overall, I will rate it 10/10 and definitely would rewind it all over again.</td>

<td>Universiti Teknologi MARA Kedah branch is the place I have chosen to continue my education in diploma and currently degree for  Library Management  (IM 120 & IM244) under the Faculty of Information Management. When learning for diploma I had the chance to experience it face to face for three semester, but when the pandemic started the fourth semester is when the classes all shifted to online learning; for the second half of the semester. It is hard to adapt at first, but in my opinion online classes is a great approach as it gives student the opportunity to be more productive by their own.  It is a great experience. Overall, I will rate it 10/10.</td>
