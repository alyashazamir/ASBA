<p><b>Cooking : </b></p>
<p>I love cooking since I was a little girl. Cooking really helps0 distracting me when in stressful times. My parents; especially my father, always teach my siblings and i the tips and recipes in cooking. Usually I would be the second person that handles the cooking beside my father. I really love to cook something simple but tasty. In the future, i wanted to try baking something such as cookies, bread and cakes because i really love these types of food. </p>

<p><b>Drawing : </b></p>
<p>Drawing is something that i really wanted to major in when i was thinking about my ambition in primary school. Unfortunately, the secondary school that i attended did not have art subject, instead they have caligraphy as the substitute. I did participate in a caligraphy contest; where everyone are obliged to take part, where i win number 1 in the contest for the category of grade 1 (13 years old) at that time. I was suprised that i can win because there are a lot more beautiful caligraphy than me. But then i realized that i actually decorate my caligraphy with collage and drawing, maybe that is why i won. Nevertheless, i am not an expert in drawing, but i really enjoy doing it.</p>
